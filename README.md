This repo contains some solutions to programming exercises from exercism.io's Haskell track.
Test suites are provided by exercism (they are not my work), just the solutions in the src files.
Not the most interesting stuff, but probably shows some of the styles of solutions I tend to write.

I didn't write any of this with an audience in mind, but realized that most of the code I write is not open-source, leaving potential employers without a lot to look at ðŸ˜‰. So I'm posting it in case you're perusing my profile and found it lacking.
